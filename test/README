This directory contains data for testing the aruco library.
The directory contains:
  - video.avi: video showing a piece of paper with six diferent markers
  - intrinsics.yml: file with the intrisic parameters, in YAML format as provided by the calibration.cpp application of OpenCv2.2


In order to test the library with these files you can use :

- aruco_simple: the simplest example. 
      Run it as:  > aruco_simple image-test.png intrinsics.yml 0.05
- aruco_test: a more sohpisticated example
     Run it as: > aruco_test  video.avi  intrinsics.yml  0.05  
- aruco_test_gl: example showing how to use OpenGL
     Run it as:  > aruco_test_gl   video.avi   intrinsics.yml  0.05  


NOTE:The option   0.05 indicates that the real size of the marker's sides in meters (5 cm).


Enjoy!
